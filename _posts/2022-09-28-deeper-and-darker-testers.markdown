  Hello, everyone!
  
  As you may have seen in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GDNRd5yvxa), you can now apply to become a tester!
  
  By becoming a tester, you can help us by looking for bugs in future updates. You can apply to become a tester in [this Google Docs form](https://forms.gle/3iMpuSvnsmuepAyy8). You should also be aware that not everyone will be picked.

  Have a nice day! (Or evening, depending on your region.)
